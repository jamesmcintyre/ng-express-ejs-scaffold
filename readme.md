# ng express gulp ejs scaffold

This is just a temporary repo for some quick scaffolding.

To install:

1. Clone this repo
2. `cd` into the project directory
3. Enter `npm run setup`.  This will delete any temp directories, install all dependencies, and do an initial build of your frontend.

To run the app:

1. Run `gulp` in one terminal
2. Start the server with `nodemon` in another.
3. View the app at localhost:3000

Then you're ready to go!
